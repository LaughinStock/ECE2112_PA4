This Programming Assignment deals with the use of Data Wrangling and Data Visualization. 

Data Wrangling is the process of gathering, collecting, and transforming Raw data into another
format for better understanding, decision-making, accessing, and analysis in less time. 
Data Wrangling is also known as Data Munging.

Data Visualization provides a good, organized pictorial presentation of the data which makes
it easier to understand, observe, and analyze.
